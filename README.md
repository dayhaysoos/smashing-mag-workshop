# How to Build Content-Rich eCommerce Sites with Next.js and the Jamstack

## Welcome

The Jamstack can be an excellent way to power eCommerce sites. In this free workshop from our friends at Netlify, Nick DeJesus will walk you through how to create fast, reliable, and content-rich Jamstack sites using Next.js, Netlify, Stripe, and Prismic.

This workshop assume you've got a developer environment set up with Node js and can install packages with npm

## Setting up

You're going to need accounts for the following platforms:

### Netlify for hosting and dev environment

[https://www.netlify.com/](https://www.netlify.com/)

### Prismic for CMS

[https://www.prismic.io/](https://prismic.io)

### Stripe for payment processing

[https://www.stripe.com/](https://stripe.com)

You're also going to need to install the Netlify CLI:

`npm install -g netlify-cli`

As well as the Prismic CLI so you can clone this workshop:

`npm install -g prismic-cli`

To clone the repo, run the following command:

`prismic theme --theme-url https://github.com/dayhaysoos/smashing-mag-workshop --conf prismic-config.js`

You'll be prompted to give a name to the project, you can call it `smashing-mag-workshop`

(This should give them the prismic repo with Custom Types already set up, need to figure out how to set them up with docs properly)
